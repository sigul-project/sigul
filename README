Overall design
--------------
There are three separate computers involved:
* the signing server, which should be as isolated as possible
* a bridge that accepts connections from the server and from clients
* at least one client that sends requests to the bridge

The instructions below are the minimum to get you started with sigul.  If you
are creating new certificates, it is safer to create them in a separate NSS
database not accessible to sigul, import the server/bridge certificates and
keys to the sigul databases, and only import the CA certificate (not the CA
private key!) to the sigul databases.  To import a CA certificate from one NSS
database to another:
	certutil -d $source_dir -L -n my-ca -a > ca.pem
	certutil -d $dest_dir -A -n my-ca -t CT,, -a -i ca.pem
	rm ca.pem
To copy a certificate and key from one NSS database to another:
        pk12util -d $source_dir -o cert.p12 -n $cert_nickname
	pk12util -d $dest_dir -i cert.p12
	rm cert.p12

Setting up the bridge
---------------------
The bridge gates access to the signing server, and transfers RPM data from and
to koji.  To set up the bridge:

* Create a NSS database for the bridge:
	bridge_dir=/var/lib/sigul
        certutil -d $bridge_dir -N
  (you'll be asked to choose a NSS database password)
* Create a new CA certificate:
        certutil -d $bridge_dir -S -n my-ca -s 'CN=My CA' -t CT,, -x -v 120
  Alternatively, import an external CA certificate:
        certutil -d $bridge_dir -A -n fedora-ca -t CT,, -a \
		-i ~/.fedora-server-ca.cert
* Create a certificate for the bridge (replace at least BRIDGE_HOSTNAME)
        certutil -d $bridge_dir -S -n sigul-bridge-cert \
		 -s 'CN=BRIDGE_HOSTNAME' -c my-ca -t u,, -v 120
  Alternatively, import a certificate and a key from a .pem file:
	openssl pkcs12 -export -out bridge.p12 -in openssl-cert.pem \
		-name sigul-bridge-cert
        pk12util -d $bridge_dir -i bridge.p12
	rm bridge.p12

* Configure the bridge: edit /etc/sigul/bridge.conf:
  Note the default ports, edit at least fas-user-name and fas-password and the
  [nss] section.  The default configuration assumes you set up a separate
  "sigul" user and group; remove the [daemon] section if you want the bridge
  to run as the invoking user.
* If you use a separate user and group:
	chown sigul:sigul $server_dir/*.db

* Run the bridge in a debug mode:
	sigul_bridge -v -v
  You should see the first log message in /var/log/sigul_bridge.log:
	2008-11-24 16:20:29,454 DEBUG: Waiting for the server to connect
  Keep the bridge running (e.g. open a new terminal)

  After you are satisfied with the function of the system, enable and start the
  sigul_bridge service.

Setting up the server
---------------------
The server stores the keys and performs crypto operations.  To set up the
server:

* Create a NSS database for the server in $server_dir=/var/lib/sigul
  (see above)
* Import the CA certificate and private key used to generate the certificate for
  the bridge:
        pk12util -d $bridge_dir -o ca.p12 -n my-ca
	pk12util -d $server_dir -i ca.p12
	rm ca.p12
	certutil -d $server_dir -M -n my-ca -t CT,,
* Create a certificate for the server, or import it from a .pem file
  (see above).  Use 'sigul-server-cert' as a nickname.

* Configure the server: edit /etc/sigul/server.conf:
  Note the default ports.  Edit at least bridge-hostname and the [nss] section.
  The default configuration assumes you set up a separate "sigul" user and
  group; remove the [daemon] section if you want the server to run as the
  invoking user.
* If you want a GPG home directory different from the default
  /var/lib/sigul/gnupg, create it.  Its location is specified either in
  server.conf ("gnupg-home"), or, if that is not defined, in settings.py
  ("default_gnupg_home")
* If you use a separate user and group:
	chown sigul:sigul $server_dir/*.db

* Create the server's database:
	sigul_server_create_db
* Add the initial administrator:
	sigul_server_add_admin
* Run the server in a debug mode:
	sigul_server -v -v
  You should see the first log message in /var/log/sigul_server.log:
	2008-11-24 16:36:42,154 DEBUG: Waiting for a request
  ... and the bridge should log:
	2008-11-24 16:41:42,214 DEBUG: Waiting for the client to connect

  After you are satisfied with the function of the system, enable and start the
  sigul_server service.

Setting up the client
---------------------
* Create a NSS database for the client in $client_dir=~/.sigul.
  (see above)
* Import the CA certificate used to generate the certificate for the bridge
  (see above)
* Create a certificate for the user, or import it from a .pem file
  (see above).  Use 'sigul-client-cert' as a nickname,
  CN=YOUR_FEDORA_ACCOUNT_NAME as the certificate's subject ('-s' option to
  certutil).  Use 'u,,' as a parameter to the '-t' (trust) option.

* Configure the client: edit /etc/sigul/client.conf:
  Note the default port.  Edit at least bridge-hostname, server-hostname
  and the [nss] section.  Edit user-name to be the same as the user name of the
  server administrator you have created before.

* Run the client:
	sigul -v -v list-users
  This should ask for administrator's password and then output a single
  line containing the administrator's user name.

Note on setting up the client
-----------------------------
After the system is deployed using the Fedora CA and certificates issued by the
Fedora CA, a client can be confiured simply by running
	sigul_setup_client
This scripts imports ~/.fedora-server-ca.cert and ~/.fedora.cert into ~/.sigul;
~/.sigul will be the default $client_dir.

Guide to the commands
=====================
See (sigul --help-commands) and (sigul $command --help) for details.  Note that
each user has a potentially different pass phrase for each key they have access
to, and some users (e.g. administrators) may have a password that is not
related to any key.
* Create a new user on the server:
	sigul new-user [--admin] [--with-password] new_user_name
* Create a new key, making key_admin an administrator of the key (an user
  that can grant or revoke access to the key to/from other users):
	sigul new-key [--name-real=..] [...] --key-admin key_admin new_key_name
  (This can take quite a long time because gpg needs to generate enough
  entropy.)
* Import an existing key, making key_admin an administrator of the key:
	gpg --export-secret-key your-key-name > foo.gpg
	sigul import-key --key-admin key_admin new_key_name foo.gpg
* Grant access to the key to another user:
	sigul grant-key-access key_name grantee_name
  (To try access as different users, edit conf/client.conf:[client] user-name
* Clearsign a text message:
	cat > my-text-file << EOF
	[...]
	sigul sign-text -o signed-text-file key_name my-text-file
* Sign a binary file:
	sigul sign-data -o data-file.gpg key_name data-file
* Sign a local RPM:
	sigul sign-rpm -o signed.rpm key_name unsigned.rpm
* Download a RPM from koji, sign it and store it locally
	sigul sign-rpm -o signed.rpm key_name basesystem-8.1-1.noarch
* Download a RPM from koji, sign it and store the signature into koji
  (UNTESTED!!)
	sigul sign-rpm -o signed.rpm --store-in-koji --koji-only key_name \
		unsigned.rpm
  NOTE: This is currently disabled in the code, it requires a koji configuration
  (in /etc/koji.conf or ~/.koji/config) that allows authentication, submitting
  signatures and proxy authentication.
* Provide passphrases noninteractively, to sign data from scripts:
  Use --batch, supply NUL-terminated pass-phrases on stdin (if the interactive
  mode asks for a particular passphrase twice, supply it only once).  E.g.:
	printf 'MY_PASSPHRASE\0' | sigul --batch \
		sign-data -o foo my_key pyrpm-0.70-1.src.rpm
